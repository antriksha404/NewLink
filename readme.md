## Getting Started

Newlink is a monorepo managed with [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/), making it modular and scalable for diverse project requirements.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20 or later)
- npm (v8 or later)

---

### Installation

Use the Newlink CLI to quickly initialize your project:

```bash
npx @newput-newlink/cli
cd my-project
```

#### Installation Process

During installation, the CLI will guide you through two key configuration steps:

-> Architecture Selection: Choose between Monolithic or Microservice architecture based on your project requirements.
-> Service Setup: You'll be prompted to enable the various services. Enter 'Y' to include this feature in your installation.

The CLI tool handles all dependency installation and initial setup automatically, creating a production-ready service configured to your specifications.
What Happens Next?
After completing these steps, the NewLink CLI will:

Install all required dependencies
Generate necessary configuration files
Set up your chosen architecture
Configure the services
Initialize your project with the selected settings

Now your NewLink service is ready for development and deployment.
